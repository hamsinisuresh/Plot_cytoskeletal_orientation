Number of images in different color formats or magnification for each stripe:\
SLB1 - 18, SLB1 greyscale - 27\
SLB2 - 60\
SLB3 - 48\
SLC1 - 16, SLC1 20x -26, SLC1 40x - 6\
SLC2 20x - 29, SLC2 40x -28\
SLC3 20x - 28, SLC3 40x - 20\
SLC4 20x - 16, SLC4 40x - 34\
SLE1 20x - 35, SLE1 40x - 26\
SLE2 20x - 36, SLE2 40x - 21\
Homogeneous substrate 40x - 52

Images in each folder are names sequentially (from green-channel to greyscale, from 20x to 40x).
